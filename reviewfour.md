## Summary
Semblance is a puzzle platformer game with a dark and simple design. You play as a blob trying to fix your world and save your people from the crystal baddies that have taken over your world trees, hardening your soft landscape. 

There are a total of four world trees that must be cleansed. The structure of the levels is similar to that of Mario. You have enter the initial world tree, then you must cleanse the crystal from the six sub-trees found inside the world tree. Once the world tree is cleansed the next tree is unlocked. Each world tree introduces new mechanics as the game progresses, creating some brain stumping puzzles as these mechanics start to combine in the later sub-levels of the tree. Some of these mechanics cross over into the other world trees, making the puzzles more difficult.

One of the big mechanics and basis of the game is the playdough like world you are in. You have the power to manipulate the platforms by raming into them. You can stretch them up or down by jumping into on onto them. You scale walls by squishing them inwards and move whole platforms by hitting them. Your base abilities are a velocity boost in any of the four directions which can be used only once until you land again. Your second ability is resetting the platforms with an area of effect. This comes in handy as hitting certain spots can be pretty teadious. 

The earlier levels start off as a tutorial, teaching about your abilities and how to manipulate the world around you. Later mechanics are introduced with each advancing level, all of which kill you instantly. These range from simple crystal spikes to death lazers. Some of the more advanced ones and by far the most difficult to deal with are the light beams that reset the platforms if touched and the ability suppression clouds.
