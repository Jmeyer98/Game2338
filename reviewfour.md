## Summary
Semblance is a puzzle platformer game with a dark and simple design. You play as a blob trying to fix your world and save your people from the crystal baddies that have taken over your world trees, hardening your soft landscape. 

There is a total of four world trees that must be cleansed. The structure of the levels is like that of Mario. You have to enter the initial world tree, then cleanse the crystal from the six sub-trees found inside the world tree. Once the world tree is cleansed the next tree is unlocked. Each world tree introduces new mechanics as the game progresses, creating some brain stumping puzzles as these mechanics start to combine in the later sub-levels of the tree. Some of these mechanics cross over into the other world trees, making the puzzles more difficult.

One of the big mechanics and basis of the game is the playdough like world you are in. You have the power to manipulate the platforms by ramming into them. You can stretch them up or down by jumping into on onto them. You scale walls by squishing them inwards and move whole platforms by hitting them. Your base abilities are a velocity boost in any of the four directions which can be used only once until you land again. Your second ability is resetting the platforms with an area of effect. This comes in handy as hitting certain spots can be tedious. 

The earlier levels start off as a tutorial, teaching about your abilities and how to manipulate the world around you. Later mechanics are introduced with each advancing level, all of which kill you instantly. These range from simple crystal spikes to death lasers. Some of the more advanced ones and by far the most difficult to deal with are the light beams that reset the platforms if touched and the ability suppression clouds.

## Final Thoughts

While the concept of the game is simple in design, the puzzles are what got me. I enjoyed playing it and found myself getting better the longer I played. Some of the levels do have similar way to solve a puzzle which, at first, I was annoyed by. I would reach a puzzle and instantly knew "Oh this is what you do," and would fly through it. I later found out that these were a blessing in disguise once the suppression clouds came into play. These are by far the most infuriating mechanic that was introduced. They made the simplest solution to a puzzle obsolete forcing you to think of an alternate way to reach the goal. I didn't think a platformer could make someone rage quit till these showed up. I had to take some time to calm down and go back in with a clear mind just to get past some of these levels.

However, as mad as I got it made me appreciate these more difficult levels of the game. I went from easily solving the puzzles to testing different methods. It became less of a simple solve the puzzle get the reward and more of a "How can I do this in a way no one would expect." It kept the game interesting and made the reward that much more satisfying.
