### Rating

I have to rate this game a 4 out of 10 joysticks.

## Summary
The game follows the story of Lenna, a school teacher on a quest to save her students. Due to unforseen circumstances glitches start to appear distorting the world around her. With her students now trapped in a glitched school-house it is up to Lenna to find out what is causing it to get her students back. This leads her to meeting the hero of the world Lance. Lenna must teach Lance how to fight if they want a fighting chance of saving their now broken world. A glitch takes out Lance leaving Lenna to inherit his power and take over as this world new hero.

Lenna must save the prince from the corrupt Chairman of the Banker's Guild who is unleahhing the forces of chaos in the world. She must travel the island in an old school Zelda dungeon crawler fashion taking on the forces of the Archangels. She must defeat all eight Archangels in order to get to the true force behind the glitches. In true Zelda fasion each Archangel has a special gimmick that you must use in order to defeat them. This leads to some unique battles such as melting a Santa Clause esq snowman and throwing bombs into the mouth of a land squid.

You can gather a plethora of items each with their own boons. Collect tunics that offer benefits such as blast protection or the ability to turn poison into a way of healing. Lenna starts off with the hero's sword but can eventually upgrade to a dagger that shocks your enemies or the worlds strongest katana. The game offers many tools that add several ways to defeat enemies allowing for unique ways to battle. 

One of the unique aspects of the game is that the world is procedurally generated. This makes every playthrough a different experience than the last. Adding to the replayability is the fact that there are multiple endings to the main story. You can choose a path of violence killing every archangel you encounter or a path of compassion using your words rather than a sword to have them admit defeat. The game also features multiple game modes such as a daily dungeon challenge as well as several gimmick dungeon modes. 

## Final Thoughts

I enjoyed the simplicity of the game. It starts off as what seems like a Zelda parody, but soon finds its own footing as a unique experience. However, it does need some work. In the game you can get a follower to aid you in battle. The thing is, these followers seem to be broken. They will go ahead of the player in dungeons, disappearing into other rooms. They also get locked out of rooms when the player enters first and barriers block the doors. These followers ended up not providing much aid in dungeons because of this fact. The overall art style and battle mechanics do give it a sort of nastalgia. I would have rated the game higher out of pure nastalgia if I hadn't hit a dead end in my first playthorugh. I was in the sixth dungeon when I reached target barriers that I clearly needed a bow to pass. I searched every area that I could, talked to every NPC, and visited every shop on the map and I couldn't find the bow anywhere. I assume you get the bow in the sixth dungeon however I hit another roadblock. In one of the rooms you get locked into there is one enemy. This enemy was unkillable. I spent ten minutes hitting it and it just didn't die. I couldn't progress and ended up having to kill myself if I wanted out of that room. The game is great in concept, but still needs some polishing to be worth its ten dollar price tag.
