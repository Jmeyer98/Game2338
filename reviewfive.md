## Summary
Knowledge is Power is a party trivia game played with two to six people using the playlink app by the same name. It is like Kahoot if Kahoot was a game show. There are a total of six characters to choose from as the contestants of the show. The game consists of three rounds with three questions per round along with two intermission rounds. The points you gain from the start of the game will determine how much of a head start you get when climbing the pyramid. The goal of each game is to be the first to the top of the Pyramid of Knowledge gaining you bragging rights as the Champion of Knowledge.

At the beginning of each question you are given the option to choose from four categories. The category chosen changes the question being asked. The category is chosen by majority vote or at random in the case of a tie between two or more categories. Each player has what is called a Power Pick that can be used only once per game that forces their category to be chosen. As the game progresses each player gets the option to sabatoge the others using their choice of Power Plays. Since the person who answers the correct answer fastest gets the most points these can change up the lead quickly. These Power Plays have various effects such as taking away letters from the opponents answers or freezing their answers in a layer of ice. These can be stacked and multiple players can attack the same person. 

There are two intermission rounds in between question rounds. The questions for these are chosen at random and can consist of any category. The first of these is a matching game like sports team to their state. The second is a sorting game where you are given two options and have to sort the answers into the right choice. The final stage of the game is the Pyramid of Knowledge. The questions here are chosen at random and the faster you answer plays into how high you advance up the pyramid. Each round has a specific Power Play. Once you reach the last four steps of the pyramid the Power Plays are used on everyone. The first player to the top of the pyramid gets the Scroll of Knowledge and wins the game.

## Final Thoughts

I have played this game a whole bunch with my friends and managed to pull off like two wins. The characters you get to choose from are a joy to watch as you get questions right and wrong. Over all the game is really well done. Even with many playthroughs I have yet to see a repeat question in any of the rounds. The questions can be hit or miss sometimes. I've gotten questions that are so simple and other times the whole party just stares at the TV confused on what the answer could be or how anyone would know it. I will say that one of the downsides is how the categories are set up. They tend to go down a sort of rabit hole. If the category Moon was chosen then the categories for the next question are going to be something like Gas Giants, Space Station, Stars and a random one that will send you down a different rabit hole. This can be frustrating, but also rewarding as you learn something new with every game.
