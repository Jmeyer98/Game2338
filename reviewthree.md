## Summary
The game follows the story of Stella, a young girl who has become the new Spiritfarer in the world of the deceased, and her cat companion Daffodil. As the Spiritfarer you are tasked with helping spirits pass on to the afterlife. You must travel to different islands around the world finding lost spirits and fufilling their last wishes in order for them to move on. 

There are many things you will have to manage while sailing to the different islands. The main one is the spirits happiness. You want to make sure the spirits happiness stays up as they will provide help through various task on your ship from cooking meals to helping your plants grow. You do this by keeping them fed, providing them with their favorite foods, hugs, and building them personalised houses unique to each spirit. Food can be aquired in many ways. You can fish off the back of the boat and gather various fruits and vegetables from the island you visit. You can also grow food in the three farming structures that can be built on your ship. All the food gathered in the world can then be cooked in the kitchen, which once upgraded will allow you to combine two ingridents for more complex dishes.
