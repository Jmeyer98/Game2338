## Summary
The game follows the story of Stella, a young girl who has become the new Spiritfarer in the world of the deceased, and her cat companion Daffodil. As the Spiritfarer you are tasked with helping spirits pass on to the afterlife. You must travel to different islands around the world finding lost spirits and fulfilling their last wishes in order for them to move on. 

There are many things you will have to manage while sailing to the different islands. The main one is the spirits happiness. You want to make sure the spirits happiness stays up as they will provide help through various task on your ship from cooking meals to helping your plants grow. You do this by keeping them fed, providing them with their favorite foods, hugs, and building them personalized houses unique to each spirit. Food can be acquired in many ways. You can fish off the back of the boat and gather various fruits and vegetables from the island you visit. You can also grow food in the three farming structures that can be built on your ship. All the food gathered in the world can then be cooked in the kitchen, which once upgraded will allow you to combine two ingredients for more complex dishes.

In order for you to build these houses and facilities on your ship you are going to need materials. This goes into resource management. You can gather materials such as logs, minerals, and ores from the various islands. These items can then be used to build facilities such as a sawmill, loom, and a foundry. These are used to acquire more advanced resources such as ingots, planks, and fabrics. Some of the more rare resources such as lightning bottles and bright jelly are acquired through events that are unlocked as certain spirits start traveling on your ship. 

You can also buy resources from the shops found on the islands using the currency of glims. This can be acquired in many ways. You can get glims by completing delivery quests, fishing up glim bottles from your boat, and gathered in the special resource events. You can also sell valuable treasures for hefty amounts of glims. This currency is also used to purchase upgrades for your ship.

## Final Thoughts

I quite enjoyed playing the game. The hours seemed to fly by as I traveled from island to island wanting to see more of the beautiful world. It is a side scroller, so the controls are not hard to understand and the art style of the game is nice. It really gives of a warm welcoming feeling with all of its soft colors and simplistic landscape. The music is so soothing to listen too as well. The ship size did get in the way after a while which was a little frustrating. After the spirits move on their houses stay on the ship, which is nice in a way, but they soon become too much and take up so much space that there is no room for the actual work facilities. 

Another thing that was done well was the story of each character. Each spirit has their own backstory. As you complete their wishes you learn more and more about their lives up to now. The game has a way of getting you attached to the spirits as you bond on your journey. So, when the time comes when they are ready to move on you feel this sort of loss knowing you will never be able to talk to them again. The game was done really well, and I would recommend giving it a try.
