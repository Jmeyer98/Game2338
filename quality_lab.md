## Minecraft

One of the quality factors Minecraft portrays is usability. The concept of the game itself is easy to follow and use. It doesn't take a lot of effort to learn the base mechanics of the game, which makes it easier for first time players to get into the game. The game is also consistent with its reliability. The game tells you what to do and how the world works, and it sticks to that. Inventory chests are always there and won't just disappear. Creepers explode when too close and TNT won't just explode unless activated.

## Elder Scrolls Online

ESO has the quality factor of interoperability. It has this in its cross-platform gameplay. Players on PC and console can play together through the same server, with each player sharing the same experience on different gaming platforms. It also has the quality of correctness. The game satisfies the requirements of an MMO such as a party system, dungeons, boss fights, a main story and lore, tons of side quests, and character creation and customization.

## Beat Saber

The usability of Beat Saber is straightforward. You slash moving blocks in the directions of their arrows to the beat of a song. It doesn't require much effort to learn how to play the game especially since it has four difficulty levels. It can be learned quickly by the beginner player and picked up easier by more experienced rhythm game players. It also has the factor of flexibility. The game has great modability and can be adapted to many different songs. The PC version of the game has custom song mods that still play like the base game even though they were created for the purpose of playing songs that were not inputted into the game itself.
